Just for fun.\"\r   }\r   ```\r - And responds with a simplified yoda speak simply switching every 2 words:\r   ```json\r   {\r     \"sith_text\": \"Is this example my sentence. Arrgh. Uhmm. For just fun. Err..err.err.\"\r   }\r   ```\r - it keeps the capital positions and the end of sentences\r - if a sentence doesn't contain even number of words, it leaves the last as is\r - always puts (one or two) random things at the end of sentences\r - if the input doesn't contain the text or its empty, respond with:\r   ```json\r   {\r     \"error\": \"Feed me some text you have to, padawan young you are. Hmmm.\"\r   }\r   ```",
