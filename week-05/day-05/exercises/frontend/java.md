# Frontend

Today your job is to create the backend part of the application for an existing
frontend app provided as an HTML and JavaScript file below.

- First create a new Spring project
- Add dependencies: Web, Thymeleaf, DevTools
- Create a `MainController` with a single endpoint to `/`
  - render `index.html` here
- Download the `frontend.js` and the `index.html` file from [here](./assets) and
  place it under your project
  - The `index.html` should go into `resources/templates`
  - The `frontend.js` should go into `resources/static`
  - (create the folders if they're not yet created)
- Try to run your app and check the index page
- If you see a nice page where you can test the following exercises, proceed to
  the next one.
