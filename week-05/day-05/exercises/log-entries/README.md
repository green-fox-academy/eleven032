# Log entries

- Create a log object which has the following fields:
  - createdAt - date and time
  - endpoint - string
  - data - string
- Create a database table for storing log objects
- Modify your previous endpoints to save a log object
  - where the createdAt will be the timestamp of the creation
  - the endpoint will be the name of the endpoint that was used when the object
    was created
  - the data will be received data (query params, received json data)
- Create a `GET /log` endpoint
- That responds with all the log entries from the database and the number of
  them:
  ```json
  {
    "entries": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "endpoint": "/doubling",
        "data": "input=15"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "entry_count": 11
  }
  ```
