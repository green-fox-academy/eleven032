# Guess my number

## Exercise

Write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 100. The player
is then asked to enter a guess. If the player guesses wrong, then the program
gives feedback and ask to enter an other guess until the guess is correct.

- Make the range customizable (ask for it before starting the guessing).
- You can add lives. (optional)

## Example

```text
I've the number between 1-100. You have 5 lives.

> 20
Too high. You have 4 lives left.

> 10
Too low. You have 3 lives left.

> 15
Congratulations. You won!
```
